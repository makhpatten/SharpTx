# SharpTx
Code to implement SharpTx
This code is provided as an example of a coding project, implemented by Mark Patten c. 2018
(Originally from a work project, sanitized to remove project names and sensitive information)
C code implemented on a PIC 18LF2520 microcontroller, and compiled using the CCC library of PIC functions
The microcontroller controls the RF hardware to implemt a "sharp end" transmitter
The transmitter also has hardware for receiving a remote control signal, which the microcontroller reads and uses to control transmitter functions
